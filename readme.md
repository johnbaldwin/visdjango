#Getting Started

  clone the repository and navigate to the 'visdjango' directory

  NOTE: I recommend using virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper to create an environment to isolate the packages for this project
  from your user environment or system packages

Install the package dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The demo in the current state does not use the database, so no database setup is required

To run the demo server:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now point your browser to localhost:8000
